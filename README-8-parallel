GNU APL supports, to some extent, execution of APL programs on multiple
CPU cores in parallel.

1. Supported Platforms
======================

As of SVN 484 parallel execution in GNU APL requires the following:

a.	POSIX thread (pthread) support

b.	functions pthread_getaffinity_np() and pthread_setaffinity_np() to
	set core affinities (i.e. which thread runs on which CPU core) of the
	threads created by GNU APL for parallel execution.

c.	an atomic fetch-and-add function

While a. is normally available on all platforms supported by GNU APL, b. and
c. may not be available. Recent Linux versions provide a., b., and c., Other
platforms may be added later.

2. ./configure Options
======================

Parallel execution is currently experimental and must be ./configure'd
explicitly (see also README-2-configure). There are two ./configure options
related to parallel execution:

   CORE_COUNT_WANTED and
   PERFORMANCE_COUNTERS_WANTED

The first option, CORE_COUNT_WANTED, controls how many cores shall be used
for parallel execution, while the second option, PERFORMANCE_COUNTERS_WANTED,
enables performance counters in GNU APL. Performance counters are needed for
fine-tuning the parallelism as explained in the following.

There are also two top-level make targets called 'parallel' and 'parallel1'
'make parallel' calls ./configure with CORE_COUNT_WANTED=syl while
'make parallel1 calls ./configure with CORE_COUNT_WANTED=syl and
PERFORMANCE_COUNTERS_WANTED=yes.

3. Parallelized Functions
=========================

As of SVN 484 the following APL functions were parallelized:

a. all monadic and dyadic scalar functions
b. inner products of all dyadic scalar functions
c. outer products of all dyadic scalar functions

More APL functions may be parallelized later.


4. Performance measurements and Fine-tuning
===========================================

The first benchmarks performed with the parallelized scalar functions have
shown that 'light-weight' scalar functions such as + , -, or ⌈ may execute
faster than their sequential counterparts on one platform but slower on another
platform. The difference between platforms can be dramatic.

For that reason there is a possibility to fine-tune the break-even points
where parallel execution is performed in favor of sequential execution.
There is a break-even point for every monadic and for every dyadic scalar
function.


4.1 Theory
-----------

The sequential execution time of a scalar function is:

	A0 + (B0 × N) cycles,

where A0 is the 'start-up time' for the function, B0 is the 'per-item time
for the function, and N is the vector length. The actual shape does not matter
for scalar functions, so adding 1 2 3 4 to itself takes the same time as
adding 2 2⍴1 2 3 4 to itself.

The sequential start-up time A0 is the same for all monadic scalar functions
and for all dyadic scalar functions; the start-up time for dyadic functions
is a little longer than for monadic scalar functions.

Now let c be the number of cores. The parallel execution time on c cores
is then:

	Ac + (Bc × N) cycles,

at least when N is a multiple of c. The difference when N is a not a multiple
of c can be neglected. Again the parallel start-up time Ac is the same for
all monadic scalar functions and for all dyadic scalar functions. And Ac ≥ A0;
the difference (Ac - A0) is the additional start-up and join time for the
thread pool computing the function in parallel.

From the 4 numbers A0, B0, Ac, and Bc one can compute the break-even point BE,
which is the vector length at which parallel execution becomes faster than
sequential execution. The break-even point is:

	BE ← (Ac - A0) ÷ (B0 - Bc)

The break-even point only exists if Bc < B0, that is if the parallel per-item
cost Bc is smaller than than the sequential per-item cost B0. On some
architectures Bc = B0 ÷ c (and then (Ac - A0) is the only concern) but
unfortunately for multi-core CPUs with a shared memory this is not the case.

4.2 Measuring A0, Ac, B0, and Bc
--------------------------------

There is a workspace 'ScalarBenchmark.apl' shipped with GNU APL that measures
the parameters A0, Ac, B0, and Bc and writes a file 'parallel_thresholds; that
can be fed back to GNU APL in order to set the break-even points for all
scalar functions. The workspace can also plot the results using aplplot.

The workspace is used as  follows:

a.	'make parallel1' as discussed above
b.	adjust some parameters at the beginning of ScalarBenchmark.apl (number
	of cores, plotting yes/no, and loop counts.
c.	run, e.g.: src/apl -f workspaces/ScalarBenchmark.apl

The last step c. creates a file 'parallel_thresholds' in the current directory.
If that file is placed in one of the directories used for the 'preferences'
file (/etc/gnu-apl.d/ or /usr/local/etc/gnu-apl.d/ depending on ./configure
prefix, or $HOME/.gnu-apl.d, or $HOME/.config/gnu-apl.d) the GNU APL reads
it on start-up and sets the break-even points for the scalar functions
accordingly.

The 'ScalarBenchmark.apl' first determines A0 and Ac using small vector
lengths N. With today's CPUs the measurement results vary considerably,
Therefore several iterations are performed for each vector length and the
minimum of all iterations is taken. From these minimums the least-square
regression line for all lengths is computed.

Then 'ScalarBenchmark.apl' determines the per-item costs B0 and Bc using a
fairly large vector length N.

4.3 Example 1: Intel 4-core i5-4570 CPU using 3 cores on 64-bit linux
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We discuss only two dyadic functions, + and ⋆. + is 'light-weight' and ⋆
is not. The summary shown by 'ScalarBenchmark.apl' for + and ⋆ is:

-------------- + Mix_IRC -------------- 
average sequential startup cost:      58 cycles
average parallel startup cost:       690 cycles
per item cost sequential:             61 cycles
per item cost parallel:               95 cycles
parallel break-even length:          not reached

The good news is that the extra cost for parallel start-up and join of
(690 - 58) = 632 cycles are fairly low. We had earlier made benchmarks with
other parallel libraries which were semaphore based and showed start-up cost
in the 10000-20000 cycle ballpark.

The bad news is that the parallel per-item cost for + are higher than the
sequential per-item cost and therefore there is no break-even point for +.
The per-item cost of 61 cycles is rather close to the values of a separate
benchmark that measured the main memory access times alone (see
tools/memory_benchmark). Our best explanation for not reaching a break-even
for + (on this machine) is that there are more extra cycles caused by
main-memory access conflicts of the different cores than cycles saved
by parallelizing +.

For ⋆ the result is different because ⋆ is not as light-weight as +:

-------------- ⋆ Mix_IRC -------------- 
average sequential startup cost:      58 cycles
average parallel startup cost:       690 cycles
per item cost sequential:            147 cycles
per item cost parallel:               91 cycles
parallel break-even length:           12


4.4 Example 2: Intel 2-core E6550 CPU using 2 cores on 32-bit linux
-------------------------------------------------------------------

On this older machine the results were rather different:

-------------- Mix_IRC + Mix1_IRC -------------- 
average sequential startup cost:    2027 cycles
average parallel startup cost:      2340 cycles
per item cost sequential:            362 cycles
per item cost parallel:              210 cycles
parallel break-even length:            3

-------------- Mix_IRC ⋆ Mix_IRC -------------- 
average sequential startup cost:    2027 cycles
average parallel startup cost:      2340 cycles
per item cost sequential:            647 cycles
per item cost parallel:              340 cycles
parallel break-even length:            2

All functions were faster when executed parallel. The per-item cost were
considerably higher (in part due to the 32-bit linux) but the parallel
start-up penalty (2340 - 2027) = 313 was smaller.

Note that the start up cost vary considerably between different runs of
the same benchmark on the same machine. Therefore you should run several
measurements before trusting the result.

4.5 Other observations
----------------------

Another, somewhat unexpected observation made when looking at several
benchmarks is that the optimal number of cores seems to be N-1 (i.e. not N)
on an N-core CPU.

The reason is that other regular operating system activities such
as timer interrupts occur during the APL execution. The threads used by GNU
APL get an almost even amount of work and the threads are running at 100%
load unless the interpreter is blocked on user input. [This is a consequence
of using a fetch-and-add function instead of semaphores for synchronizing the
threads.]

If all N cores of a CPU are used by APL then the CPU schedules its activities
on one of the busy cores (and most likely the same core all the time).
That core then takes more time than the others and the entire computation\
of the APL function is delayed accordingly.

If, however, only N-1 of N cores are used then the OS sees an idle core and
will most likely perform its activities on that core. These effects are best
visualized when using the plotting option of ScalarBenchmark.apl.

5. Summary
==========

The above discussion shows that some speedup can be achieved by parallelizing
scalar APL functions. However the speedup is not as significant as a naive
observer might expect (i.e. B0÷Bc = c) and varies considerably between OS
variants and hardware platforms.

While the start-up cost of the current implementation in GNU APL look good
compared to other approaches, the per-item cost are somewhat disappointing
on some machines (and this is due to effects outside GNU APL). A corollary
of this could be that APL operations with little computational complexity
(such as A⍴B) will suffer as well and will not show good speedups when
executed in parallel.

In any case is it worthwhile to fine-tune the break-even points of the
different scalar functions.
