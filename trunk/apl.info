1 Installing and Starting APL
*****************************

1.1 Installing APL
==================

APL is built and installed like this:

   * download and unpack the tar file containing GNU APL

   * read (and follow) the instructions given in file README in the
     unpacked directory

   For the experienced, but impatient reader: it is the usual sequence

   * ./configure

   * make

   * make install

   On success, an executable file called 'apl' will have been produced
in the sub-directory 'src'.

   File README contains further instructions about the installation GNU
APL.

1.2 Starting APL
================

Last things first: before explaining how to start APL, it is important
to remember how to stop (i.e. exit) it. Neither ^C nor ^D will stop APL
- they serve other purposes. Instead, you leave APL with the command
)OFF (on a separate line) like this:

   )OFF

   If APL is computing a function (and possibly caught in an endless
loop), then you may have to press ^C (called ATTENTION in APL) in order
to return to APL's command mode and then give the )OFF command.

   Having that said, APL is started like every other program - entering
its name and optional command line parameters, for example:

   $ apl

   or:

   $ apl --id 1001

   APL is script-able; a text file whose first line looks like this
(assuming the APL interpreter binary is called apl and can be found in
the shell's PATH):

   #! apl

   or (if the APL interpreter binary is /mypath/apl but not necessarily
in the shell's PATH):

   #!/mypath/apl

   The text file must, of course, have execute permission, and should
be ASCII or, more likely, UTF-8 encoded. The APL characters in the
script shall be those defined in the Unicode character set (most of
them in the 0x2200 - 0x23FF range).

1.3 Command Line Options
========================

APL understands the following command line options:

   * `--cfg'

     show ./configure options used and exit.

   * `-d'

     run the interpreter (or script) in the background (i.e. as daemon)

   * `-f file'

     read input from file (after all -T files) rather than from the
     keyboard.  When the end of the file is reached, input is switched
     back to the keyboards.  If you want to terminate the APL
     interpreter after executing the file, use )OFF as last line in the
     file.

   * `-h', `--help'

     print all command line options with a brief hint what they do.

   * `--id proc'

     use processor ID proc for this interpreter. If no ID is provided,
     then the first unused ID > 1000 is taken by this interpreter and
     the ID becomes used as long as the interpreter runs. Processor IDs
     are used by shared variables to identify share partners.

   * `--noCIN'

     do not echo stdin to stdout. Almost a must for scripting (unless
     you troubleshoot a script).

   * `--noCONT'

     do not load a CONTINUE workspace on start-up.

   * `--noSV'

     do not start APnnn (a shared variable server) on start-up. This
     disables communication with other workspaces or auxiliary
     processors through shared variables.

   * `--par pproc'

     use processor parent ID pproc (default: no parent ID).

   * `-s', `--script' this option is an abbreviation for:  `--silent'
     `--noCIN' `--noCONT' `-f -' which is a typical combination of
     options for APL scripts.

   * `--silent' suppress printing of the GNU APL welcome message.
     Useful for scripts.

   * `-T testcases ...' run testcases. Testcases are text files that
     contain both input to the APL interpreter and the expected
     response from the interpreter. The output from the interpreter is
     compared with the expected output in the testcase file(s) and
     differences are marked. In addition a summary file is created that
     tells whether or not each of the testcases was successful.

   *  `--TM mode'

     test mode. This option how the interpreter shall behave when
     running a number of testcases (as specified with the `-T' option)

     `--TM 0' (default) run all testcases and exit after the last
     testcase.

     `--TM 1' like `--TM 0' if no error was detected.  However, if one
     of the testcases has failed, then the interpreter does not exit so
     that the user can investigate the state of APL (SI, variable
     values, etc.).

     `--TM 2' like `--TM 1', but stay in the interpreter even if all
     testcases have passed. This can be useful in order to quickly bring
     the interpreter into a specific state and continue manual
     troubleshooting from that state.

     `--TM 3' like `--TM 1', but stop testcase execution after the
     first failed testcase (i.e. do not exit).

     `--TM 4' like `--TM 3', but exit after the first failed testcase.
     The is useful for automatic regression tests, where no errors are
     expected.

   * `--TS'

     Normally, when the interpreter is run with the `-T' option, then
     an existing summary.log file is overridden without notice.  This
     option causes new test results to be appended to a possibly
     existing summary.log instead of overriding it.

   * `-v', `--version',

     show version information and exit.

   * `-w milli'

     wait milli milliseconds at start-up. Useful to give other programs
     that are started together with this interpreter time to initialize
     themselves.

   * `--'

     end of options for the interpreter. There is a system variable
     ⎕ARG that returns all command line arguments of the interpreter
     (like argv in main(int argv, char * argv[]) in C). Option -- can
     be used to separate command line options for the APL interpreter
     from command line options understood by APL applications.

     Thus,

     `(⎕ARG ⍳ ⊂'--') ↑ ⎕ARG' returns the options for the APL
     interpreter, while

     `(⎕ARG ⍳ ⊂'--') ↓ ⎕ARG' returns the options for the APL
     application.

     All command line options after `--' are ignored by the interpreter
     (except making them available in ⎕ARG).


1.4 Config File for GNU APL
===========================

The default values for some of the command line options discussed in the
previous section can be set in a configuration file for GNU APL. The
name of the configuration file is 'preferences' and it should live in
one of the following directories:

   * in the sub-directory gnu-apl.d of the system configuration
     directory, or

   * in the sub-directory .gnu-apl of the user's home directory (as per
     $HOME).


   The system configuration directory is usually /etc or /usr/local/etc
and is configurable via `./configure --sysconfdir'. An empty (i.e. all
settings commented out) preferences file is being installed in the
system configuration directory when GNU APL is installed. You can edit
it or use it as a template to see which options can be controlled.

   If file 'preferences' exists in both directories, then the settings
in $HOME/.gnu-apl/preferences override settings in, for example,
/etc/gnu-apl.d/preferences.

   Command line options in turn override settings in 'preferences'
files.

1.5 File Names and Paths
========================

The GNU APL interpreter is a binary file named apl. It is usually
installed in directory /usr/bin/ or in /usr/local/bin/. The location
where apl is installed can be changed via ./configure options (see file
INSTALL).

   GNU APL understands 4 file types:

  1. APL workspaces that can be manipulated with the )LOAD, )SAVE,  and
     )COPY commands. APL workspaces are XML files and must have a  file
     extension of .xml in order to be accepted by GNU APL. APL
     workspaces  can only be exchanged between machines that all run
     GNU APL.

  2. APL exchange files can be manipulated with the )IN and )OUT
     commands. APL exchange files are text files in ⎕TF format defined
     by IBM  (basically APL expressions that create variables or
     functions)  and must have a file extension of .atf in order to be
     accepted by GNU APL.   APL exchange files can be exchanged between
     machines running APL interpreters from  different vendors. The ⎕TF
     format can be easily emulated on machines not  providing
     compatible )IN and )OUT commands.

  3. APL scripts consist of APL commands and APL expressions (including
     function definition via ∇) like they would be entered by the user.
     APL scripts should have a file extension of .apl but other
     extensions  are also accepted by GNU APL. APL scripts are, for
     example, the files  expected for the -f command line option.

  4. APL testcase files are similar to APL scripts, but in addition to
     the APL commands and expression they also contain the expected
     output from  from the commands  APL testcase files normally have
     have a file extension of .tc for normal  (functional) testcases
     and .pt for performance testcases.   APL testcase files are, for
     example, the files expected for the  -T command line option.


   The following APL commands are related to file names:

   )LOAD [lib] name[.xml]

   )SAVE [lib] [name[.xml]]

   )IN   [lib] name[.atf]

   )OUT  [lib] name[.atf]

   )LIB  [lib]

   )LIBS [new-lib-root]

   )WSID       [name]

   The rules how file names are constructed from the arguments of an APL
command are:

  1. command arguments shown in brackets are optional.

  2. lib is a number from 0 to 9. If lib is not present then 0 is taken
     as default.

  3. if the name is optional and missing then the workspace ID (the name
     set with )WSID) is used.

  4. if the file extension (i.e. .xml or .atf) is missing then it is
     appended automatically to name.

   If the name starts with '/' then it is taken as an absolute path to
the file (an absolute file name) and no further computation is done
with the name.

   Otherwise name is a relative path which is relative to some directory
library-root and a sub-directory of library-root that is determined by
the lib number. The library numbers 0-9 correspond to the following
directories:

   0: library-root/workspaces/

   1: library-root/wslib1/

   2: library-root/wslib2/

   ...

   9: library-root/wslib9/

   The command )LIBS shows the mapping between library numbers and
paths, or sets a new lib-root.

   The command )LIB [lib] shows the files in library (i,, directory)
lib.

   The directory library-root is computed as follows when the
interpreter starts:

   If an environment variable APL_LIB_ROOT is defined, then its value
is used as library-root. Otherwise the path from the current directory
(".") up to the root directory ("/") is searched until a directory
containing two files 'workspaces' and 'wslib1' is found. Normally
'workspaces' and 'wslib1' are directories, but for the computation of
library-root files suffice.

   If such a directory is found, then it is used as library-root;
otherwise the current directory (i.e. ".") is used and converted to an
absolute path.

   For example, if library-root id "." then the command

   )LOAD 2 test

   will try to load the workspace file

   ./wslib2/test.xml

2 Non-standard Features
***********************

There are a few possibly useful features in GNU APL:

2.1 APL Scripting
=================

as already mentioned, it is possible to write APL scripts. Like for
other script languages, the script starts with `#!', followed by the
absolute or relative path to the interpreter, followed by command line
arguments passed on to the interpreter. In our case this could be, for
example:

   There are essentially two ways to run an APL script: redirecting the
script file to stdin of the interpreter or making the script executable
and indicate apl as the script interpreter (followed by some command
line arguments for apl).

2.1.1 redirect the script file the stdin of the GNU APL interpreter
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A file, say script.apl, can be redirected to apl by redirection of the
shell:

    apl < script.apl

   Alternatively, the command line option -f of apl can be used:

    apl -f script.apl

   Both ways of redirecting the file are almost identical; in the first
case redirection was performed by the shell running apl, while in the
second case the redirecting of the file was performed by apl itself.

2.1.2 make the script file executable
-------------------------------------

Alternatively the script can be made executable, mentioning apl as the
interpreter for the script (see also `man execve'). For this to work,
the first line of the script must have a special format

    #! /bin/apl -f - --

   or, more typically for scripts:

    #! /bin/apl --script --

   `--script' prevents: printing of a welcome banner, echoing of stdin
to stdout, automatic loading of a )CONTINUE workspaces,  and prevents
starting of a thread for shared variable communication.

   If the path to the interpreter is relative (which might be useful if
you do not know in advance where the APL interpreter will be installed)
then it must be in $PATH of the shell that runs the script).

   In order to be really useful for scripting, two more features have
been added:

   The system variable ⎕ARG contains all command line arguments passed
to the interpreter. In the first example above this would be a nested
3-element vector:

    /bin/apl --id 1010

   A feature particularly useful for CGI scripting (where some
information is passed to the APL script via environment variables) is
the monadic system function ⎕ENV B. ⎕ENV B returns all environment
variables whose name starts with B. If ⍴B is 0, like:

    ⎕ENV ''

   then all environment variables are returned.  The result of ⎕ENV is
a N-by-2 matrix.  The first column is the name of the environment
variable.  The second column is the value of the variable.  The number
N of environment variables returned obviously depends on the number of
environment variables whose name begins with the prefix given in B. B
is case sensitive, but by convention the names of environment are
uppercase.

   If you need to create a longer text, line the body of a web page,
then you would normally construct it like this:

   BODY←⊂'First line' BODY←BODY←⊂'Second line' BODY←BODY←⊂'Third line'
 ...

   That is not very handy for longer texts. Instead you can write the
following in an APL script:

   BODY←⎕INP 'END-OF-⎕INP' First line Second line Third line    ...
END-OF-⎕INP

   This works like "Here documents" in bash. The right argument of ⎕INP
is the end of text marker, ⎕INP also has a dyadic form where the left
argument specifies an escape sequence from text to apl and back to the
text, similar to PHP scripts:

   '<?apl' '?>' ⎕INP 'END-OF-⎕INP' First line Time is now: <?apl ⍕⎕TS ?>
Third line ...  END-OF-⎕INP

   These features together allow you to write Web pages in APL!

2.1.3 Script Example
--------------------

Note that the two different ways of running an APL script have an
impact on how ⎕ARG looks like. If stdin is redirected then there is
only one (possibly empty) set of command line options. Otherwise there
are two set of command line options: command line options for the apl
interpreter and command line options for the script.

   Consider the following simple script called script.apl in directory
workspaces:

#! /bin/apl --script --

⎕ARG    ⍝ show command line options
)OFF    ⍝ leave the interpreter

   If script.apl is redirected to stdin of the APL interpreter:

 /bin/apl --silent <  ../workspaces/script.apl
 or
 /bin/apl --silent -f ../workspaces/script.apl

   then the first line `#! /bin/apl --script --' of file script.apl is
merely a comment (GNU APL accepts both the traditional APL character ⍝
and the character # as start of a comment). The `--script' option is
therefore ignored and the following mix of input and output is shown on
the screen. The input from the script is indented by the usual APL
prompt of 6 blanks, while the output of the APL interpreter is not
indented.

      #! /bin/apl --script --

      ⎕ARG      ⍝ show command line options
 /bin/apl --silent
      )OFF      ⍝ leave the interpreter

   If we run the same script directly:

../workspaces/script.apl

   Then we get:


 /bin/apl --script -- ../workspaces/script.apl

   The `script' implies `--noCIN' so that the input lines for the
interpreter are no longer echoed to the output.  That is most likely
what you want when writing a script.

   Also, the first line of the script is no longer ignored as a comment,
but controls the command line argument (and thus ⎕ARG) of the
interpreter.  The additional command line argument
`../workspaces/script.apl' comes from function execve (see man execve).

   If we provide an argument, say SCRIPTARG, to script.apl:

../workspaces/script.apl SCRIPTARG

   then it shows up at the end of ⎕ARG:


 /bin/apl --script -- ../workspaces/script.apl SCRIPTARG

2.2 Debug Commands
==================

Besides the classical commands like )LOAD or )SAVE there are a number of
debug commands that start with ] rather than ).  Regular commands start
with ) and print their output on stdout.  Debug commands start with)
and print their output on stderr. Normally you cannot easily
distinguish between stdout and stderr, but another feature, colored
output, uses different colors for stdout and stdout.

   Type )HELP or ]HELP in the interpreter for a list of all commands
available.

2.3 Colored Output
==================

The APL interpreter gets its input from the standard input (stdin),
which is normally connected to the user's keyboard, but can also be a
file if APL scripting, the `-f' option,  or the `-T' option is used.

   The APL interpreter prints its results on either the standard output
(stdout) for normal APL output, or to the error output (stderr) for
additional trouble-shooting information.

   You can print the 3 channels stdin, stdout, and stderr in different
colors by means of the debug command ]XTERM. Command ]XTERM ON enables
colored output while ]XTERM OFF disables it (for example to avoid
annoying ANSI Escape sequences when forwarding stdout or stderr to a
file).

   Colored Output assumes a terminal (-emulation) that understands ANSI
(or VT100) Escape sequences. The xterm that comes with most recent
GNU/Linux distributions is a perfect choice supporting both colors and
UTF-8 (Unicode) encoded character I/O.

   The colors (actually the escape sequences used to switch to a color)
can be changed via ./configure, see README-2-configure).

2.4 Logging Facilities
======================

The APL interpreter has over 30 logging facilities. Each logging
facility can be ON (and then produces some logging output on stderr) or
OFF. The decision which logging facility shall be ON and which shall be
OFF can be made at compile time (of the APL interpreter) or at run-time.

   If the decision is made at compile time - we call that static
logging - then it cannot be changed later on. Otherwise - we call that
dynamic logging - there is a debug command ]LOG that allows to turn
logging facilities to be turned ON or OFF.

2.4.1 Static Logging
--------------------

By default the logging facilities that shall be turned ON are defined
statically. To change the logging facilities that shall be turned ON,
you can edit the file src/Logging.def which defines the different
logging facilities. The first argument if macro log_def() tells if the
logging facility shall be ON (1) or OFF (0).

   Static logging results in a faster interpreter than dynamic logging
because the decision if something shall be logged or not is made at
compile time and not at run-time.

   If you benchmark the APL interpreter, then ./configure Static
Logging by NOT setting DYNAMIC_LOG_WANTED=yes.

2.4.2 Dynamic Logging
---------------------

Dynamic Logging is intended for trouble-shooters of GNU APL, but also
for those who are interested in the internals of GNU APL. Dynamic
Logging is enabled by setting DYNAMIC_LOG_WANTED=yes when running
./configure.

   If Dynamic Logging is enabled, then the already mentioned file
src/Logging.def determines the initial setting of each logging facility.

   The command

   ]LOG

   (without arguments) then shows all logging facilities and their
current state. The command

   ]LOG N

   toggles the state of logging facility N from OFF to ON and back.

2.5 Complex Numbers
===================

Complex numbers are fully supported.

3 Limitations and Missing Features
**********************************

APL is an almost full implementation of the ISO standard 13751.
However, a few limitations exist. See file README-4-compliance for an
up-to-date descriptions of limitations.

3.1 System Limits
=================

APL integers are 64-bit wide, thus ranging from -9223372036854775808 to
9223372036854775807

   APL floating point values are 64-bit wide, thus ranging from
-8.98E307 to 8.98E307.

   APL values have a maximum rank of 8. This value can be increased,
however, by means of ./configure (see README-2-configure).

3.2 Shared Variables
====================

The system functions and variables for shared variables, i.e. ⎕SVO,
⎕SVR, ⎕SVC, ⎕SVS, ⎕SVQ are implemented.

   Communication between two workspaces is supported, but with some
limitations. Two workspaces must run on the same machine in order to
communicate via shared variables.

   However, only two auxiliary processors, AP100 and AP210, are
provided as examples for implementing auxiliary processors.

   Shared variables for auxiliary processors are provided for some
backward compatibility. In the past - without access to the source code
of the APL interpreter - shared variables were the only method
available to extend the functionality of the interpreter.

   With this interpreter - and access to its source code - it is often
more convenient to add your own commands or your own system variables
to the APL interpreter rather that adding auxiliary processors.


File: apl.info,  Node: Chapter 4,  Next: Chapter 5,  Prev: Chapter 3,  Up: Top

4 Internationalization
**********************

GNU APL is internationalized by means of GNU gettext. Currently one
language, German, is available in addition to English.

   For APL characters to work properly with keyboards and terminal
emulators (see also README-3-keyboard) it is essential that your LANG
environment variable is correctly set. For German, that would be
"de_DE.utf8", like:

   $export LANG=de_DE.utf8

   A misspelling of the language can cause APL characters to become
unavailable, even if you xmodmap is correct. You can check your setting
by executing the program 'locale'.  If it  shows warnings like these:

   locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or
directory locale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such
file or directory locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such
file or directory

   then something is wrong and you should check your LANG setting and
installed locales.

   As a last resort, you can ./configure GNU APL with -disable-nls, but
that may not fix problems related to the keyboard or to the terminal
(emulation).

   As far as xterm is concerned, the xterm command line options -u8,
-lc, and -en might solve problems related to the terminal.

     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.

5.2 The GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
==================================

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE                        Version 3, 29 June
2007

   Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

   Preamble

   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program-to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   0. Definitions.

   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
of works, such as semiconductor masks.

   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making
of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of
the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

   1. Source Code.

   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
widely used among developers working in that language.

   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if
any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce
the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
work.

   2. Basic Permissions.

   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in
force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of
having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar
laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the
covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
 it, and giving a relevant date.

   b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
released under this License and any conditions added under section
7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to     "keep
intact all notices".

   c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

   d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your     work
need not make them do so.

   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in
or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used
to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond
what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an
aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of
the aggregate.

   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
ways:

   a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium     customarily
used for software interchange.

   b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as     long
as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the     Corresponding Source
from a network server at no charge.

   c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
with subsection 6b.

   d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

   e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
  you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
charge under subsection 6d.

   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included
in conveying the object code work.

   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a
consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
"normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of
product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way
in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected
to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of
whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or
non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode
of use of the product.

   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product
from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information
must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified
object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by
the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply if
neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified
object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been
installed in ROM).

   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include
a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or
updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the
recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or
installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification
itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or
violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

   7. Additional Terms.

   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for
which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

   a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
 terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

   b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
 author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
Notices displayed by works containing it; or

   c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
  requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

   d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
  authors of the material; or

   e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

   f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
those licensors and authors.

   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional
terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find
the applicable terms.

   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the
above requirements apply either way.

   8. Termination.

   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to
receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing
other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify
any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not
accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered
work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction
who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the
work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the
previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding
Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor
has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

   11. Patents.

   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence
of further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of
this definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent
sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this
License.

   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to
copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned
on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you
are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the
business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the
third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work,
and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would
receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a)
in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or
copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection
with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work,
unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was
granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations
under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to
terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from
those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy
both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from
conveying the Program.

   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

   14. Revised Versions of this License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

   Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   16. Limitation of Liability.

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

   <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it
does.>     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

   This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
   it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
   the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

   This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the     GNU
General Public License for more details.

   You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

   <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>     This program
comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.      This
is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it     under
certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an "about box".

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow
the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first,
please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.
